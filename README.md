Thank you to [Dirk Lemstra](https://github.com/dlemstra/code-sign-action) for providing a base for me to create this action. 

# Code sign a file

This action signs files that are supported by `signtool.exe` with a code signing certificate that takes in a password. This action only works on Windows and that means it should run on `windows-latest`.

## Inputs

### `certificate`

**Required** The base64 encoded certificate.

### `password`

**Required** Certificate Password. Used to add to the machine store. 

### `certificatesha1`

**Required** SHA1 hash for the certificate. You can obtain this from Microsoft Management Console after double clicking on your certificate (called Thumbprint). This and/or the `certificatename` is required for the signing to be successful. 

### `certificatename`

**Required** The name of the certificate. This and/or the `certificatesha1` is required for the signing to be successful. 

### `folder`

**Required** The folder that contains the libraries to sign.

### `recursive`

**Optional** Recursively search for DLL files.

### `timestampUrl`

**Optional** Url of the timestamp server.  Default is 'http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll'

## Example usage
